# HiddenMarkovModelDemo

This Repository demontrates transition probabilistic  matrix to explain HMM part 1

Reference: http://www.adeveloperdiary.com/data-science/machine-learning/introduction-to-hidden-markov-model/

Here the key thing to learn is we do not have transition state possibility between state 1 and 2. probability of 0 indicates the same.
